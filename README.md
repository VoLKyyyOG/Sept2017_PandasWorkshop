# Introduction to Pandas, September 2017 Edition

Pandas is a Python package for visualising, cleaning and analysing spreadsheet-type data inside the programming language Python. 

This Pandas workshop will be running from 10am - 3pm on Friday 1st September, at the CoLab training space, also known as __Room 329, Level 3, Eastern Resource Centre, Building 171__. Enter the ERC at the glass doors to the left of the kiosk, "Resource cafe", head to the back of the lobby (keep the ERC library entrance on your left). Colab will be inside the glass door at the back right of the "Colab VIP Lounge". 

This workshop is designed for those trying to explore and learn about the Python package Pandas for the first time. The content is suitable for a range of learners, though users will preferably already have some familiarity with Python. 

This workshop will be using Python 3.6 inside the Jupyter Notebook. You can find installation instructions inside the 
[Python_Installation.md](https://github.com/resbaz/Sept2017_PandasWorkshop/blob/master/Python_installation.md)
instruction file. 

While we will be learning in the Jupyter environment, you may find this a bit heavy for your day-to-day coding life. 
There are a number of light-weight text editors and Integrative Development Environments (IDEs - this means you can write and 
run your code in the same program) freely available on the internet.

IDEs:
- Spyder. This comes installed with the Anaconda package, and you should be able to find it in your system's programs list after installation
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This one has a free community-edition license, but anybody working on research which could be patented, beware! The pycharm owners dislike the free version being used on for-profit projects, and the licensing reflects this.

Text Editors:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/). Free. No ads. Allows Git/Github integration.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Unlimited free license. Occasional pop-up ads. Slightly easier to use.

You will also find that the content for the workshop is available in both the markdown (\*.md) format, for online viewing, and as an iPython notebook (\*.ipynb), which will contain useable code fragments, challenges and explanations for the workshop content.
